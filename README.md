# React + Vite footwear-showcase
## About
This project is a responsive, single-page React website designed for a shoe brand with a focus on simplicity, performance, and visual appeal. The website aims to deliver a clear brand message: "Your Feet Deserve the Best," and guide users to explore product categories seamlessly.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
